# Firefox addon to help YOU manage your out of control tabs!
#### Description:

This is a chrome addon. You can install it on firefox using this repo! https://github.com/Explodey-Wolf/Tab-Manager-Pro The purpose is simple. If you get too many tabs open, default of 20(configurable), you can then open up a tab manager to help you clean up! It shows tabs in a list type view. You can select multiple items with control, one item with no modifiers, and a line of items with shift clicks. You can scroll through this list, and when a tab is blue, it means it is selected. You can click "url" to open that tab again in a new tab. Clicking "snooze" in the tab warning page will automatically bring you back to the previous tab that you were in. Press Escape to deselect, and Delete to close tabs. Right click to open up a context menu to close and move to a new window. Closed tabs can be reopened like normal. Clicking the extension icon opens up a menu where you are able to configure the amount of tabs the warning opens up as, and open up the tab manager.

This project was made as a final project for the Harvard CS50. Note that opening a New Tab into a new window does not work, and will just ignore it. Opening a new window with no tabs will just open a window with one tab. Happy browsing!

Thank you for viewing my final project, and I hope you have a great day. If you find an issue, feel free to make an issue in this github repo! I will update this readme in the future when my addon is approved.
